                        Banking is the best-known financial services and the most profitable. Companies in the banking sector are known to make huge profits. They provide credit and deposits services to their clients in return of interests. Some have extended their products' portfolio by offering services ranging all over.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Banks are classified into two major categories, which are commercial banks and investments banks. Commercial banks are the normal banks dealing with deposits and credit services. Investments banks on the other hands are banks offering capital markets services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another big sector of the finance industry is the Insurance sector. It growth rate at the moment is high compared to other sectors because the penetration is still low in many countries. Insurances deal with underwriting of risks by providing covers on loss of property or lifes in return of premiums.

                    <p>
                       The most successful ones though are the ones that are innovative and changes with the environment. Those that have adapted to technology changes have leaped big profits in the process and those that haven't have fallen short in revenues. The financial sector is a dynamic environment and all companies need to keep up to survive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other sectors of the banking services are not as common as the above two. Foreign Exchange services though is quite popular but mostly offered by all banks as an extra service. Investment services are also offered by many financial services companies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are various factors that affect the industry positively and others that affect it negatively. Factors such as the increase of interest rates will increase profits for companies in the financial industry, while a decrease will minimize profits. Companys' in the financial sector need to train and educate their employees consistently to maintain a good reputation and good client company relationship.
                    </p>
