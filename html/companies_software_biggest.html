                      Most software startup companies in the world have had a rough ride growing their businesses. Before the invention of the internet, computers were not that common hence software companies' market was not that big. Today, that has changed enormously. Now computers are so many and are being used in all sectors of our lives, so the market has grown.

                    <p>
                        In the early days, softwares were purchased in discs and installed in discs. One had to go to the shops where they were being sold, purchase, and then goes with it home to install it. Installation for some was so difficult, one had to hire experts to install it for you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Internet has made things simple, now one can buy, access documentation online, download the software, and install it right away. The Internet has so much information that it is easier to do things now. Some of the softwares have actually shifted to be online-based software where one can access the software through web browsers. No installation required. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But even with all these developments, softwares companies are facing a lot of issues. Some issues have developed because of the internet itself. With all the information available on the web, it easier to access the softwares illegally. Piracy has become a main challenge of the software companies where these softwares are being cracked and used with licensing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also there is competition from free softwares. Software companies get revenue through selling their softwares. As of now, with the availability of free information on the internet, people have become tech savvy and are building softwares for themselves then instead of selling it is offering it for free. Competing with free software, which offers the same value as the software being sold is a big challenge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Also there is a new trend of open-sourcing software where individuals will develop a software and then release to the internet community with source code where anyone can access and edit to improve the software. This has been a big challenge to for companies that thrive by selling softwares to people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, even with the harsh environment, some companies have managed to grow enormously. Like Microsoft, it owner Bill Gates was the world richest man for over two decades. Below is a list of the top 10 biggest software companies in the world.
