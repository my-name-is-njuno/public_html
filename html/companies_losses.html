                        The one term that all investors of a company are afraid of is the word LOSS. In business, loss means expenses are greater than revenues which means ones is losing money which means the investor of a business are losing cash. Business exist to make money and not lose money. Nobody likes that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are many reasons which can lead to a business making a loss. Some of the reason are self inflicted while others are due to external factors. By self inflicted I mean factors that a business owner can be prevent from happening. External factors that can lead to losses are the one the business operator cannot control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many companies have come and gone because of the losses they made. Consistent losses by a business leads to close down of the business. This is because no one like tolerating losing money continuously. Some people will close a business down on occurrence of first loss. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Losses like profits are reported by a company through the profit and loss account (statement of income). This statement is used by investors and other interested parties to determine the income of a company. Losses are computed through getting the excess of expenses on revenue. That is Total Expenses - Total Revenue. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although huge losses have lead to close of many businesses, some have used the losses as motivation and come back stronger by making profits in the subsequent periods. This can be achieved through various ways such as deciding to change the ways things are done in a business, keeping track of business finances etc. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only good side of making losses is that a company is not taxed. Some companies have used this trick where they report losses so as not to be taxed. This however should be noted is illegal and if caught can lead to fines, charges or even jail. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The below list is a ranking of companies that have reported the highest losses ever. Note that some of them have been closed down and others learnt from the losses and came back stronger. See below.
